## Installing Gantry 5 and the IWI Core Wordpress Theme

Gantry 5 is a framework by which Gantry-powered themes are made. In order for a Gantry theme to work, you will need to install both the **framework** and the **theme**. Doing this is not difficult at all.

## Accessing the IWI Administrator

### Wordpress
When you have installed and activated both the Gantry framework and IWI, you can access the Gantry 5 administrator login to your 
wp-admin/login.php with your wordpress username/password. 

To install the Gantry plugin, you'll need to navigate to Plugins â†’ Add New in the admin area of WordPress. One easy way to find this area is to navigate to Plugins in your sidebar, then select the Add New button next to the title of the page.

If plugin is not activated theme wont work!

Here, you will see a list of wordpress properties and at last you can reach the IWI Wordpress Framework

## How to Navigate at IWI Admin Dashboard

The IWI Administrator has multiple administrative tools you can flip through to configure how your Gantry-powered theme looks and functions. Here is a quick breakdown of each of these tools, and what you can do with them.

You will notice the following menu items in the IWI Administrator:

1. **Menu Editor**: This administrative panel gives you the ability to enhance the platform's menu by altering styling, rearranging links, and creating menu items that sit outside of the CMS's integrated Menu Manager.

2. **About**: This page gives you quick, at-a-glance information about the currently-accessed theme. This is a one-stop shop for information about the theme including: name, version number, creator, support links, features, and more.

3. **Platform Settings**: This button takes you to the CMS' settings page for IWI.

4. **Clear Cache**: This button clears the cache files related to Gantry. This includes all of the temporary files outside of CSS and configuration information.

5. **Outlines Dropdown**: This dropdown makes it easy to quickly switch between Outlines without having to leave the Gantry Administrator.

6. **Styles**: This administrative panel gives you access to style related outline settings. This includes things like theme colors, fonts, style presets, and more.

7. **Settings**: This administrative panel offers you the ability to configure the functional settings of the theme. This includes setting defaults for Particles, as well as enabling/disabling individual Particles.

8. **Layout**: This administrative panel is where you would configure the layout for your theme. Creating an placing module positions, Particles, spacers, and non-rendered scripts such as Google Analytics code is all done in this panel.

## What are Outlines, Particles, Atoms, etc.?

Because Gantry 5 is so different from any version of Gantry before it, we came up with some terms to help make sense of the relationships Gantry's new features have with one-another. Here is a quick breakdown of commonly used terms related to Gantry 5.

| Term          | Definition                                                                                                                                             |
| :-----        | :-----                                                                                                                                                 |
| Outline       | A configurable style used in one or more areas of your site. It serves as the container on which a page's style, settings, and layout are set.         |
| Particle      | A typically small block of data used on the front end. It acts a lot like a widget/module, but can be easily configured in the Gantry 5 Administrator. |
| Atom          | A type of Particle that contains non-rendered data, such as custom scripting (JS, CSS, etc.) or analytics scripts for traffic tracking.                |
